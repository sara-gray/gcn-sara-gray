# Global Cycling Network Technical Challenge


## Code Documentation

This code shows some suggested improvements to the navigation for the website [Global Cyclying Network](globalcyclingnetwork.com)

- The design reduces the top navigation to make it simpler and easy to interact with.
- Social links are now tucked away at the bottom of the screen.

### Please note - I have only implemented this for an iPhone6, dimensions 375 x 667

## Further Improvements

I have focused on a simpler UI so further improvements I would implement are:
1. Implement a search facility with auto complete for the categories you currently display in your menu
2. Functionality to the video section
